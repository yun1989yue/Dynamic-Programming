You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint 
stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police 
if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob 
tonight without alerting the police.

After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much 
attention. This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. 
Meanwhile, the security system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street. 

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob 
tonight without alerting the police.

Idea:
The difference between I and II is that the 1st house and the last house can be robbed at the same time in I but not in II
Hence maxPro[2<->n-2]+nums[0] is max cash robbed with 1st house
maxPro[1<->n-1] is max cash robbed without 1st house
